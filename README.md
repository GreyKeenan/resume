# Skills

## Soft Skills

I am comfortable working with others. I try to be a good communicator and a team player. Being accomodating, straightforward, and forgiving goes a long way.

My desire to understand things at a fundamental level drives me to be a critical thinker and a problem-solver. At the same time, I do my best to keep this instinct in check for the sake of making progress, rather than getting lost in the weeds.

I consider myself an open-minded and creative person, as much as I can judge that myself. I'm not afraid of embracing or proposing new ideas. 


## Developer Tools

If it's worth mentioning, I am comfortable using git/github and working on the command line in a linux/bash environment.

My classes have heavily featured the Microsoft environment, though I have not pursued these tools in my own time. I have a basic understanding of .NET, MAUI (and Xamarin), Visual Studio, Windows Forms, and Microsoft SQL Server.

I enjoy reading documentation.


## Languages

These are the languages that I have explored, some more than others. I believe that the problem-solving skills and programming concepts I've learned will allow me to learn new languages as well.

- C
> C has helped me understand how data and memory are handled at a lower level.

- C#
> I've used C# for a lot of my coursework, but not on my own time.

- Go
> I've recently started learning Go. I appreciate the balance between low-level concepts and higher-level features.

- Python
> Python was my first language. I have not used it extensively since learning other languages.

- JavaScript
> I have a grasp of JavaScript's syntax and accessing the DOM, but I have not used any frameworks.

- SQL/T-SQL
> If this even counts, I have a basic understanding of SQL and database-design principles.
