			<h2>Skills</h2>

			<h3>Soft Skills</h3>
				<p>
					I am comfortable working with others, and I do my best to be a good communicator/team player. Simply being accomodating, straightforward, and forgiving goes a long way.
				</p>
				<p>
					My need to learn and understand drives me to be a critical thinker and a problem-solver. At the same time, I do my best to keep this instinct in check for the sake of making progress, rather than getting lost in the weeds.
				</p>
				<p>
					I consider myself an open-minded and creative person, at least as much as one can judge that for themselves. I'm not afraid of proposing or embracing new ideas and concepts. Trying new things is essential for improvement, and even if they go wrong, they become an oppotunity to learn.
				</p>
			<h3>Developer Tools</h3>
				<p>
					If it's worth mentioning, I am comfortable using git/github and working on the command line in a linux/bash environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					My classes have heavily featured the Microsoft environment, but I have not pursued these tools in my own time. I have a basic understanding of .NET, MAUI (and Xamarin), Visual Studio, Windows Forms, and Microsoft SQL Server.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy reading documentation.
				</p>
			<h3>Languages</h3>
			<p>
				These are the languages that I have explored, some more than others. I believe that the problem-solving skills and concepts I've learned will transfer to other languages when necessary.
			</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Go</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>SQL</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>
					C has helped me understand how data and memory are manipulated at a lower level.
				</li>
				<li>
					I've used C# a lot for my coursework, but not a ton on my own time.
				</li>
				<li>
					I've recently started learning Go. It seems like a well-balanced language.
				</li>
				<li>
					I haven't used Python much since learning other languages. It was a great way to get started.
				</li>
				<li>
					With JavaScript, I have a grasp of the syntax and accessing the DOM, but I have not used any frameworks.
				</li>
				<li>
					I have a basic understanding of SQL and database-organization principles.
				</li>
			</ul>
