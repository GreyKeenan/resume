			<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
			<p>
				These are a few small, personal projects/explorations I've messed with. There's nothing crazy here, just a couple of things I found interesting and/or have had fun with.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Simple game using C and SDL</h3>
				<p>
					I've been making a simple, 2d, push-puzzle game using only C and SDL. It's slow going; I've just been plugging along. Right now, I am writing some code to deflate a PNG, since I'm not using SDL_Image. Reading through the PNG, zlib, and DEFLATE specifications, and learning about Huffman Coding and Lz77, has been really interesting. 
				</p>

			<h3>Minesweeper in plain JavaScript</h3>

			<h3>Star Trek random episode generator</h3>
				<p>
					I threw together a quick episode randomizer in plain JavaScript and put it up on Github Pages for my friends and I. It's pretty simple, but it's handy because it can remember which episodes have already been generated by re-shuffling the list from a known seed. Plus, you can disable individual shows.

				</p>

			<h3>Basic time-printing program in WAT</h3>
				<p>
					This is a really small thing. It just queries the time, converts it to a string, and prints it out. But, I found it interesting because I had never tried using an assembly-like language before (even if it's just web assembly).
