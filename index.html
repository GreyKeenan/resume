			<h2>Skills</h2>

			<h3>Soft Skills</h3>
				<p>
					I am comfortable working with others. I try to be a good communicator and a team player. Being accomodating, straightforward, and forgiving goes a long way.
				</p>
				<p>
					My desire to understand things at a fundamental level drives me to be a critical thinker and a problem-solver. At the same time, I do my best to keep this instinct in check for the sake of making progress, rather than getting lost in the weeds.
				</p>
				<p>
					I consider myself an open-minded and creative person, as much as I can judge that myself. I'm not afraid of embracing or proposing new ideas. 
				</p>
			<h3>Developer Tools</h3>
				<p>
					If it's worth mentioning, I am comfortable using git/github and working on the command line in a linux/bash environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					My classes have heavily featured the Microsoft environment, though I have not pursued these tools in my own time. I have a basic understanding of .NET, MAUI (and Xamarin), Visual Studio, Windows Forms, and Microsoft SQL Server.
				</p>
				<p>
					I enjoy reading documentation.
				</p>
			<h3>Languages</h3>
			<p>
				These are the languages that I have explored, some more than others. I believe that the problem-solving skills and programming concepts I've learned are more important than the actual languages themselves, but they are still relevant.
			</p>
			<ul class="inline-list">
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Go</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>SQL</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>
					C has helped me understand how data and memory are handled at a lower level.
				</li>
				<li>
					I've used C# for a lot of my coursework, but not on my own time.
				</li>
				<li>
					I've recently started learning Go. It seems like a well-balanced language.
				</li>
				<li>
					Python was my first language. I have not used it extensively since learning other languages.
				</li>
				<li>
					I have a grasp of JavaScript's syntax and accessing the DOM, but I have not used any frameworks.
				</li>
				<li>
					If this even counts, I have a basic understanding of SQL and database-design principles.
				</li>
			</ul>
