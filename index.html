			<h2>Skills</h2>

			<h3>Soft Skills</h3>
				<p>
					I am comfortable working with others. I do my best to be a good communicator and a team player. I've found that being accomodating, direct, and forgiving goes a long way.
				</p>
			<h3>Developer Tools</h3>
				<p>
					If it's worth mentioning, I am comfortable using git/github and working on the command line in a linux/bash environment.
				</p>
				<p>
					My classes have heavily featured the Microsoft environment, but I have not pursued these tools in my own time. I have a basic understanding of .NET, MAUI (and Xamarin), Visual Studio, Windows Forms, and Microsoft SQL Server.
				</p>
				<p>
					I really enjoy reading documentation.
				</p>
			<h3>Languages</h3>
			<p>
				These are the languages that I've explored, some more than others. I am confident that the problem-solving and organizational skills I have built will transfer to other languages when necessary.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>C
					<p>
						I appreciate the freedom and transparency that comes with C. It's great for learning more about software, but it's far from being the most efficient language to work in.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>C#
					<p>
						C# is powerful, but large and complex. I've mainly used it for my coursework, rather than on my own time.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Go
					<p>
						I've only recently started learning Go. It seems like a streamlined balance between low-level control and high-level niceties.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>Python
					<p>
						I haven't used Python very much since learning other languages. The ease-of-use is impressive, but I haven't taken the time look under the hood and learn about Python at a lower level.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>JavaScript
					<p>
						Similarly, I've barely used JavaScript. I have a grasp of the syntax and accessing the DOM. I have not used any frameworks.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>SQL
					<p>
						The black sheep of this list. I have a basic understanding of SQL and database-organization principles.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
