		<div id="Summary">
			<p>
				Entry-level software developer nearing graduation with an Associates Degree. Looking for a challenging job or internship where I can gain experience, work under a senior developer's guidance, and be part of a team. Eager to learn more about software development and any specific tools necessary for a given work environment.

			<h3>In-Progress: Software Developer AAS - Hennepin Technical College</h3>

			<h2>Skills</h2>

			<h3>General Skills</h3>
			<ul id="ul_GeneralSkills">
				<li>I have been told I am a good communicator, and I work hard to be accomodating to others on a team.</li>
				<li>I am comfortable using a linux/bash environment.</li>
				<li>I am comfortable with the basics of git/github.</li>
				<li>I genuinely enjoy reading documentation.</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Languages</h3>
			<ul id="FamiliarLanguages">
				<li>C</li>
				<li>C#</li>
				<li>Python</li>
				<li>JavaScript</li>
				<li>SQL</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				These are the languages I would consider myself familiar-enough with to work in right away. I have also fiddled with Go, Java, and Web Assembly Text, but I would need to brush-up with those languages before working in them confidently. I am perfectly willing to learn any new languages, even in my spare time, if necessary.
			</p>

			<h3>Microsoft and .NET</h3>
			<p>
				Though not my personal choice for projects, many of my classes have featured Microsoft tools. As such, I have a basic familarity with tools like C# with .NET, Visual Studio, .NET Maui, Windows Forms, and Microsoft SQL Server.

			<h2>Personal Projects</h2>
			<p>
				These are a few small personal projects/explorations I've messed with. There's nothing crazy here, just a couple of things I found interesting.
			</p>
			
			<h3>Simple game using C and SDL</h3>
				<p>
					I've been making a very simple 2d push-puzzle game using only C and SDL. It's a remake of one of my first projects, which originally used Godot. Currently, I am writing some code to deflate a PNG so I can make a spritesheet and/or just use PNG files instead of Bitmaps. (Without SDL_Image, SDL only supports Bitmaps by default.) Reading through the PNG, zlib, and DEFLATE specifications and learning about Huffman Coding and Lz77 was really interesting.

			<h3>Star Trek random episode generator</h3>
				<p>
					Star Trek is one of my favorite shows of all time. I threw together a basic episode randomizer in plain JavaScript and threw it up on Github Pages for my friends and I to use. It's pretty simple, but it's handy because it can remember which episodes have already been generated by re-shuffling the list from a known seed. Also, you can disable certain shows.

				</p>

			<h3>Basic time printing program in WAT</h3>
				<p>
					This is really very simple. It just queries the time, converts it to a string, and prints it out. However, I found it interesting because I had never tried using an assembly-like language before (even if it's just web assembly).
