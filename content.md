# Skills

## Soft Skills

I am comfortable working with others. I do my best to be a good communicator and a team player. I've found that being accomodating, direct, and forgiving goes a long way.


## Developer Tools

If it's worth mentioning, I am comfortable using git/github and working on the command line in a linux/bash environment.

My classes have heavily featured the Microsoft environment, but I have not pursued these tools in my own time. I have a basic understanding of .NET, MAUI (and Xamarin), Visual Studio, Windows Forms, and Microsoft SQL Server.

I really enjoy reading documentation.


## Languages

These are the languages that I've explored using, some more than others. I am confident that the problem-solving and organizational skills I have built will transfer to other languages when necessary.

- C
> I appreciate the freedom and transparency that comes with C. It's great for learning more about software, but it's far from being the most efficient language to work in.

- C#
> C# is powerful, but large and complex. I've mainly used it for my coursework, rather than on my own time.

- Go
> I've only recently started learning go. It seems like a streamlined balance between low-level control and high-level niceties.

- Python
> I haven't used Python very much since learning other languages. The ease-of-use is impressive, but I haven't taken the time look under the hood and learn about Python at a lower level.

- JavaScript
> Similarly, I've barely used javascript. I have a grasp of the syntax and accessing the DOM. I have not used any frameworks.

- SQL/T-SQL
> The black sheep of this list. I have a basic understanding of SQL and database-organization principles.
